# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that integrates document retrieval with natural language processing to enhance response accuracy and speed. The project leverages technologies such as the FAISS vector store and GPT-2 model to improve retrieval performance and response generation.

## Key Features

- **Document Embedding & Retrieval**: Utilizes FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval, significantly speeding up document access.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implements caching to reduce retrieval times for frequently requested data.
- **RAG Integration**: Combines retrieved documents with GPT-2 model processing to generate contextually relevant responses.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Includes a system to evaluate the performance enhancements from various optimizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pip
- Access to a GPU for optimal performance (recommended)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG-Model-Optimization.git
